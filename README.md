# serverust

Implementation of a very basic (also: incomplete, laughably bad) HTTP server
as an exercise in better understanding Rust as well as "how server things kinda work",
eg. processing TCP streams, request routing, etc.

Do not use this for anything. In fact, you should probably not even look at it.
If you do, I recommend ridicule as an appropriate reaction.

Pull requests to help my subpar Rust abilities are always welcome though.
